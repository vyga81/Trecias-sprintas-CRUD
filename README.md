# Employee & project MANAGER
----------------------------------
You will be able, to create employees and projects aswell delete employees and projects they belong to. 
To make the project i used technologies as PHP, Bootstrap for style, Mysql for database.


To run the project on your own system you need:
1.XAMPP.
2 MySQL workbench.


How to setup:
1. Download the zip file from  this link:
  https://github.com/vyga81/Trecias-sprintas-CRUD.git
2. Extract the folder into your XAMPP htdocs folder. The file is usualy located in:
  This PC > Local Disk (C:) > xampp > htdocs
3. In mysql workbench create a connection and import the Tables.sql as a self contained file.
  You can find the data import in the server tab. !!!IMPORTANT!!! ----> Import from self-Contained-File. 
4.Open your XAMPP and start Apache and MySQL.
5.Once all of the above steps are done you can open the website by writing: 
  localhost/'project folder name here' which would usualy look like this: localhost/app1/CRUD/index.php
